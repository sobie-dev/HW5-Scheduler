This application is designed to show Moment.js and how it is used to grab current time and dates. Bootstrap is used to help create a design and in the javascript, functions are used to dynamically update the HTML. Lastly, I used local.storage to save input data when visiting the website.

When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hour. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

When you click into a timeblock you can enter an event.
When you click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. If you refresh the page the saved event persist.
